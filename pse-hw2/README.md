# GameFour
This a two-player game is played on a board consists of n x n fields, where each field contains a value between 0 and 4. Initially, all the fields contain the value of 0. If a player chooses a field, then the value of the field and its neighbor  incremented by one (if the value is less than 4). The playerâ€™s score represents how many fields did he make to have the value of 4. If a value of a field reaches 4, then the field is colorized with the color of the actual player (red or blue). The game ends, when all fields have the value of 4. The player having the higher score wins. Implement this game, and let the board size be selectable (3x3, 5x5, 7x7). The game should recognize if it is ended, and it has to show in a message box which player won. After this, a new game should be started automatically.
