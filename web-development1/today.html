    <p class="introduction-p">   Kosovo has a population of around 1.79 million.
        There were significant gender differences throughout Kosovo's labour market, the statistical agency said in a labour force survey.
        Kosovo is not only known for being a multi ethnic country but also for its religious tolerance and coexistence. Even though the majority of population are Muslims, the religion was never a factor which destabilized the country.  Ages ago, the Kosovar Albanian ethnics were chiefly Roman Catholic by religion.  The religion changed, however, in the 14th century when the Ottoman Turks conquered Kosovo and introduced the new religion of Islam which many Albanian families found appealing and, in return, embraced in large amounts. At present, only around 3% of the Kosovar population is composed of the Roman Catholics.
       The greater part of Kosovo’s population (Muslims) practice the mainstream known as Sunni Islam, however almost all of the population residing in the villages in the region has some families that are Shi’ite Muslims. There are additional various Islamic groups but are significantly smaller in size, such as the Bektashi dervish sector</p>

              <p>PRISTINA (Kosovo), March 20 (SeeNews) – Kosovo's unemployment rate has increased to 30.7% year-on-year in 2017 from 27.5% in 2016, remaining the highest in Southeast Europe, the country's statistical agency said on Monday.
                  The unemployment rate was much higher among women, 37.1%, compared to 28.7% for men. <br>  The jobless rate in the age bracket 15-24 years remained high in 2017, at 55.9%. In 2016, the jobless rate in this age group was 52.4%.
                 <br>  About two-thirds of Kosovo's population was at working age (15-64 years) last year but just 57.1% of those people were economically active.</p>

              <p>Kosovo does not have an official religion. Like the rest of the country, the majority of Pristina's population consider themselves to be Muslim. However, most do not actively practice Islam, nor do they attend mosques or the religious services required by their religion. Many, however, do fast for Ramadan. and praying is widely practiced.
                  <br> The small minority of Pristina’s religious population that is not Muslim practice Christianity in the form of Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy. When Pristina was in the Serbian Empire in the Middle Ages, Eastern Orthodoxy was the predominant faith other than Roman Catholicism. Religious communities have educational institutions for their needs, organized in accordance with applicable law.</p>
